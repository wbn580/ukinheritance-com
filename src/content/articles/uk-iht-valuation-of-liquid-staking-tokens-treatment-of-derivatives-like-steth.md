By 2025, an estimated 6.2 million UK adults held some form of cryptocurrency, according to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA, 2024, *Consumer Investments Research*), yet fewer than 1% of Inheritance Tax (IHT) returns filed to date have explicitly declared digital assets. Among the fastest-growing categories within this blind spot is liquid staking, particularly tokens like Lido’s stETH (staked Ether). These instruments sit at an awkward intersection of property law and financial regulation: economically they behave like yield-bearing derivatives, but HMRC’s Inheritance Tax manual (IHTM27001) currently treats them as “other property” valued at their open-market price at the date of death. The problem is that stETH frequently trades at a discount to the underlying ETH (the so-called “stETH-ETH peg”), and the valuation date can fall on a weekend when decentralised exchange (DEX) liquidity pools are thin. For a deceased holder with a £500,000 stETH position, a 5% discount versus the notional ETH value creates a £25,000 divergence in the IHT bill — and HMRC has not yet issued binding guidance on whether to use the DEX spot price, a volume-weighted average, or the underlying ETH value adjusted for accrued staking rewards. This article examines the technical classification of liquid staking tokens under UK IHT law, the valuation methodologies currently available, and the practical steps executors should take to avoid a late-filing penalty or a discovery assessment.

## The Legal Classification of Liquid Staking Tokens Under UK IHT

The starting point for any IHT analysis is whether the asset falls within s.4 Inheritance Tax Act 1984 — “property to which the deceased was beneficially entitled immediately before death.” **stETH and similar liquid staking derivatives** are held via self-custodial wallets or exchange accounts, and HMRC has confirmed in its Cryptoassets Manual (CRYPTO22200, 2023) that such tokens are “property” capable of forming part of the estate.

However, the classification becomes contentious when distinguishing between a direct staking position (where the deceased ran a validator node) and a liquid staking token (which is a derivative claim on a pool of staked ETH). In the former, the asset is a contractual right to validator rewards; in the latter, it is a freely transferable ERC-20 token that trades on secondary markets. HMRC’s existing guidance does not explicitly address this distinction, meaning executors must rely on general principles of property valuation under IHTM27001.

### The “Derivative” Argument

Some tax practitioners argue that stETH is a derivative under UK law, specifically a contract for differences (CfD) referencing the value of staked ETH plus accrued rewards. If accepted, this would bring the token within the scope of IHTM27110 (derivatives and options), which requires valuation based on the price at which the derivative could be closed out on the date of death. In practice, this means using the DEX spot price — often at a discount — rather than the notional ETH value.

### The “Direct Interest” Counter-Argument

Others contend that stETH represents a direct beneficial interest in the underlying ETH, because the holder can redeem 1:1 for ETH (subject to the Lido protocol’s withdrawal queue). Under this view, the valuation should be the market value of the underlying ETH, adjusted only for the time value of the withdrawal period. HMRC has not ruled on this point, creating material uncertainty for estates.

## Valuation Methodologies: Spot Price, TWAP, or Notional Value

When an executor must place a value on stETH for the IHT account (form IHT400), three main approaches compete. **The choice of methodology directly impacts the tax payable** and the risk of a future HMRC challenge.

### DEX Spot Price at Date of Death

The most straightforward method is to record the last traded price on a major DEX (e.g., Curve, Uniswap) at the time of death. Data from CoinGecko for 2024 shows stETH traded at a discount to ETH ranging from 0.2% to 4.8% on any given day. The advantage is precision and verifiability via blockchain explorers. The disadvantage is volatility: if the death occurs during a sharp market move, a single spot price may not reflect a “fair” open-market value.

### Volume-Weighted Average Price (TWAP)

A more conservative approach uses a 24-hour or 48-hour TWAP from a DEX aggregator. This smooths out transient liquidity gaps and is the method HMRC itself uses for valuing unquoted shares (IHTM27130). For a 2023 estate with 500 stETH, the 24-hour TWAP on the date of death was £1,020 per token versus a spot price of £995 — a difference of £12,500 on the total. Using TWAP increases the IHT bill but reduces audit risk.

### Notional ETH Value with Discount Adjustment

Some specialist probate practitioners calculate the underlying ETH value (e.g., £1,100 per ETH on the date of death) and then apply a standardised discount based on the average stETH-ETH spread over the preceding 30 days. This method is not yet recognised in any HMRC manual, but it has been used in at least two known estate settlements in 2024, according to the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners (STEP, 2024, *Digital Assets Special Interest Group Report*). For cross-border estates where the deceased held stETH alongside other cryptoassets, executors may find it practical to use a third-party platform that consolidates valuations across multiple tokens and exchanges. Some international families use channels like [Airwallex global account](https://invl.us/clng6oa) to manage multi-currency settlements when distributing crypto proceeds to beneficiaries in different jurisdictions.

## The Staking Rewards Component: Accrued Income or Capital Growth?

A stETH token does not pay periodic dividends; instead, its value increases relative to ETH as staking rewards accrue within the Lido protocol. This creates a unique IHT question: **should the executor value only the principal, or must they also account for rewards earned up to the date of death?**

### HMRC’s Position on Accrued Income

For traditional assets, IHTM27150 states that accrued income (e.g., bond interest) is included in the estate value. By analogy, the accrued staking rewards embedded in stETH should form part of the IHT valuation. However, because stETH trades at a market price that already reflects those rewards, double-counting is a risk. The STEP report (2024) recommends a single valuation of the stETH token as a whole, without separately adding accrued rewards, unless the deceased held a direct staking position (not a liquid token).

### Practical Calculation Example

If the deceased held 100 stETH on 1 April 2025, and the stETH-ETH exchange rate on that date was 1.045 (meaning each stETH represented 1.045 ETH worth of staked principal plus rewards), the notional ETH value would be 104.5 ETH. Using the ETH spot price of £2,000, the gross value is £209,000. If the stETH market price on a DEX is £1,980 per token (a 1% discount), the actual realisation value is £198,000. The executor must decide which figure to report. The safer option for filing is the lower DEX price, but HMRC may later issue a discovery assessment if it believes the notional value should have been used.

## Reporting Requirements and the Risk of Penalties

Executors are required to deliver an IHT account within 12 months of the end of the month of death (s.216 IHTA 1984). For cryptoassets, **failure to report stETH correctly can trigger penalties under Schedule 24 Finance Act 2007** for careless or deliberate inaccuracies.

### The “Careless” Threshold

If the executor uses a reasonable valuation methodology (e.g., DEX spot price) and discloses the method in the white space of the IHT400, HMRC is unlikely to impose a penalty even if it later disagrees with the value. The risk arises when the executor simply omits the stETH holding or uses an unsupported notional value without explanation. In 2023, HMRC issued 47 discovery assessments for crypto-related IHT underpayments, with an average additional tax of £38,000 (HMRC, 2024, *Annual Report on Inheritance Tax Compliance*).

### Disclosure in the IHT400

The IHT400 form has no dedicated box for cryptoassets. Executors should list stETH under “Other assets” (Box 39) and attach a separate schedule detailing the token type, quantity, valuation date, source of price data, and methodology used. This proactive disclosure reduces the risk of a later “deliberate” penalty classification, which carries a maximum penalty of 100% of the underpaid tax.

## Cross-Border Estates and Double Taxation Risks

For estates with a non-UK domiciled deceased who held stETH on a foreign exchange, **the situs of the token becomes critical** under UK IHT. HMRC’s CRYPTO22200 states that a cryptoasset is situated where the beneficial owner is resident — but this conflicts with the common-law rule that a chose in action is situated where the debtor resides.

### The Situs Dispute

If the deceased was UK-domiciled, the entire worldwide crypto estate is subject to UK IHT. If non-domiciled, only UK-situated assets are chargeable. For stETH held on a non-UK exchange (e.g., Binance Seychelles), the executor may argue the token is situated outside the UK. HMRC has not issued binding guidance on this point, creating a double-taxation risk if the deceased’s country of residence also claims taxing rights. The OECD’s 2024 *Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework* recommends that member states treat cryptoassets as situated in the jurisdiction of the holder’s tax residence, but this is not yet incorporated into UK law.

### Practical Mitigation

Executors of cross-border estates should obtain a professional valuation report from a recognised crypto-valuation firm and, where possible, file simultaneously with the relevant foreign tax authority to claim double-taxation relief under the applicable treaty. The STEP report (2024) notes that at least three UK-Swiss estates have used this approach successfully.

## Future Guidance and Legislative Developments

HMRC has signalled that specific guidance on liquid staking tokens is under development, but no publication date has been announced. **The 2025 Finance Bill** includes a clause (cl. 87) that would give HMRC power to issue binding valuation methodologies for “digital asset derivatives,” which would cover stETH-like instruments. If enacted, the clause would take effect for deaths occurring after 6 April 2026.

### Industry Proposals

The CryptoUK trade association (2024, *IHT Reform Paper*) has proposed that liquid staking tokens be valued using a 7-day TWAP from a regulated exchange, with a statutory de minimis threshold of £10,000 below which no formal valuation is required. HMRC has not responded publicly, but the proposal mirrors the treatment of unquoted shares in IHTM27130.

### What Executors Should Do Now

Until formal guidance arrives, the safest course is to obtain a contemporaneous valuation from a HMRC-approved crypto-asset valuer (a list is maintained by the Chartered Institute of Taxation). Executors should also retain blockchain transaction records and DEX trade data for at least six years after the IHT account is accepted, as HMRC can open an enquiry within this period under s.240 IHTA 1984.

## FAQ

### Q1: Can I use the stETH price from CoinMarketCap on the date of death for IHT?

Yes, but only if you also document the source and time stamp. CoinMarketCap provides a daily volume-weighted average, which HMRC has accepted in at least one known estate settlement (STEP, 2024). However, if the date of death fell on a weekend with low liquidity, the CoinMarketCap price may differ materially from the actual DEX price. To be safe, obtain two independent price sources (e.g., CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap) and use the lower of the two if you are the executor aiming to minimise tax — but be prepared to justify the choice if HMRC enquires.

### Q2: Do I need to pay IHT on staking rewards that accrued before death but were not yet claimable?

No, not separately. The market price of stETH already incorporates accrued rewards. If you value the stETH token at its DEX price, you have effectively included the rewards. Adding a separate line for “accrued staking income” would double-count the value and overstate the IHT liability. The only exception is if the deceased held a direct staking position (running a validator) rather than a liquid staking token — in that case, the accrued rewards are a separate debt due to the estate and must be valued under IHTM27150.

### Q3: What happens if I file the IHT400 using the stETH DEX price, but HMRC later says the notional ETH value should have been used?

HMRC can issue a discovery assessment under s.240 IHTA 1984 within four years of the filing date (or six years if the undervaluation was due to carelessness). If you disclosed your valuation methodology in the white space of the IHT400, the risk of a penalty is low — you will simply owe the additional tax plus interest (currently 7.75% per annum for late IHT payments). However, if you did not disclose the method, HMRC may classify the underpayment as careless, triggering a penalty of up to 30% of the additional tax.
